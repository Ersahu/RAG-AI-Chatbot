{"documents":[{"pageContent":"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. What is AI? AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The goal of AI is to build systems that can perform tasks such as recognizing speech, making decisions, translating languages, and even driving vehicles. Types of Artificial Intelligence 1. Narrow AI (Weak AI): Designed for a specific task such as voice assistants and recommendation systems. 2. General AI (Strong AI): A theoretical form of AI that can perform any intellectual task that a human can do. 3. Super AI: A hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects. Applications of AI AI is used in many fields such as: • Healthcare (disease diagn","metadata":{"documentId":"695e7e0bac58007e1f6b38f2","chunkIndex":0}},{"pageContent":"ntellectual task that a human can do. 3.
